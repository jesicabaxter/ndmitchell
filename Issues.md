# Introduction #

The bug tracker at http://code.google.com/p/ndmitchell/issues/list lists all the open bugs, there are several things to know.

## Star Issues ##

If you care about an issue, star it. If you have a particular reason for caring about an issue ("this really effects me because...") then star the issue and add a comment.

## Beginner Bugs ##

Some bugs are marked beginner. These should be accessible to someone without a great deal of experience with the code base, and are great for getting started.

## HelpMe Bugs ##

These bugs are ones where I could do with some help. I either need advice from people, or there is some piece of self-contained work that could usefully be done by someone else. Some of these bugs are important, but don't justify the amount of work I'd have to do, so are currently on the backburner. Other bugs are unimportant, but there is some demand for.

## Priorities ##

The priority field is fairly arbitrary, but there should be some sort of ranking. I tend to use High for things that need fixing, Medium for things that would be nice, and Low for things that don't matter all that much. If enough people Star/comment on a bug, that will make me look at its priority again.
